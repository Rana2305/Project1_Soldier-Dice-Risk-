Soldier and Dice Risk Game

The rules of the game:
1-	Number of players: There are two players.
2-	Components: You need six dices for each player.
3-	Starting the Game: Each player antes one die. To ante a die, a player selects one of their six dice and places it in the middle of the table.
4-	Playing the Game: The youngest player goes first. On a playerâ€™s turn, that player rolls their remaining dice (five at the start of the game). After the roll, you must select one or two of your rolled dice to score, setting them aside for the end of the round. You then roll your remaining dice, again setting aside one or two dice to score. You may continue rolling and scoring as long as you have dice left to roll. Once the first player has taken their turn and written down their score, the second player now takes a turn, following the same rules.
5-	Exception of six: if the die rolls a six, that should not be counted to the total, but ads two more rolls. The new rolls should be added to the total, unless one of them is a six, then the re-rolling continues.
6-	Ending the Game: When a player has no dice left to roll, the game automatically ends. The winner is the player with the highest total score (add up the scores from each round).
